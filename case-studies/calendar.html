        <h1 id="title">Google Calendar Redesign</h1>
        <h2>Redesigning Google Calendar's Event Creation Interface</h2>
        <h3 id="background">Background</h3>
            <p>Imagine you're a busy professional, juggling multiple tasks and appointments throughout the
                day. You rely heavily on your Google Calendar to stay organized and on track, but its lackluster
                interface does little to inspire or excite you about your upcoming events. To make matters
                worse, the cluttered and overwhelming interface presents too many unnecessary options when
                all you need is a streamlined and simplified approach. <br>
                For many individuals, keeping track of daily tasks and schedules is a necessary but often 
                tedious aspect of life. For example, students trying to balance schoolwork and extracurricular
                activities or working professionals juggling multiple projects. <br>
                Using a calendar can help them stay organized and on track.
            </p>
        <h3 id="problem">Problem</h3>
            <p>
                However, simply having a calendar is not enough - the challenge lies in maintaining the motivation 
                to stick to a schedule and finding excitement in the tasks at hand. This problem is especially 
                relevant in today's fast-paced world where distractions are plentiful and burnout is common. <br>
                As a student myself, I use Google Calendar to keep track of my class schedule, the times for office 
                hours for each class, meetings and interviews, upcoming events, etc. Even though I have everything 
                on my calendar, often I'll just not want to go to class or events. Calendars should inspire motivation 
                in individuals as much as they can being just calendars. For example, a friend told me she color codes 
                her classes and makes the ones that she doesn't like colors that she does like so she'll be motivated 
                to go to them. <br>
                This is what our Google Calendar redesign aims to address, offering more options for customizations 
                to meet both practical needs and aesthetic desires. <br>
                Most calendars look the same - how can we make Google Calendar different or special besides the fact 
                that it is convenient to use as part of the Google Suite of apps?
            </p>
        <h3 id="overview">Project overview</h3>
            <p>
                Therefore, there is a need for a solution that not only provides a functional calendar but also encourages 
                users to stay engaged and motivated in their daily activities. This is important because most calendars focus 
                on functionality and less on how it looks. <br>
                This project was done in a group of six as a final project for DSGN 1: Design of Everyday Things. We all 
                participated in each of the parts of the project, and I mainly focused on the problems and trends we discovered 
                through the interviews we conducted through which we were able to brainstorm potential solutions, which my 
                group mates used to create prototypes.
            </p>
        <h3 id="interviews">User interviews</h3>
            <p>
                Since we wanted the scope of our project to be specific, we focused on the event creation functionality in Google 
                Calendar. <br>
                We first asked users questions to assess their background knowledge and current impressions of Google Calendar, 
                for example, their familiarity with and usage of it, what they think about the aesthetics and customizability 
                of the interface. <br>
                Some examples of questions: 
                    <ul>
                        <li>Are you familiar with Google Calendar? If so, how often do you use it in a week?</li>
                        <li>Do you use any other online calendars? What functions would you want/expect Google Calendar to have for 
                            creating calendar events?</li>
                        <li>What do you think about the overall layout of the event creating screen?</li>
                        <li>Rate the aesthetics of the interface of Google Calendar</li>
                    </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                We also had users complete a specific task of creating an event with specified parameters. We then asked them to rate 
                the difficulty of this, and also took notes on what we observed as they were working on the task. <br>
                Task: Ask the interviewee to create an event for a lecture that occurs every Monday from 5 pm to 6
                pm EST at York Hall in the color green. Also, add a description of the Room # and set a
                notification for this event to occur every 10 minutes. <br>
                The main issues discovered through these interviews were:
                <ul>
                    <li>There was a split amongst interviewees about the aesthetic - some thought it was clean and
                        simple, others thought it was cluttered and complicated</li>
                    <li>Many users wanted more customization options</li>
                    <li>The main difficulties surrounded not being able to find a button or a function being
                        inconvenient</li>
                    <li>Many interviewees complained about there being too many unnecessary features
                        like the large Google Meet button</li>
                </ul>

            </p>
        <h3 id="existing">Existing calendars</h3>
            <p>
                <img src="calendar/design-space1.png" alt="design space" height="350px">

                <br>
                Compared to existing calendar applications, Google Calendar is on the more functional and standardized 
                side, versus others that are more aesthetic and customizable. It is the most similar to Apple Calendar.
            </p>
        <h3 id="redesign">Redesign</h3>
            <p>
                On the event creation screen we created redesigns for a more simplified interface to address clutter and 
                improve the aesthetic, and implemented a time zone menu and time-to-leave feature. <br>

                <img src="calendar/reordering.png" alt="reorder/hide features" height="250px">
                <img src="calendar/reordering.gif" alt="reorder/hide features" height="250px">
                <br>One of the redesigns we created was one to reorder and hide features that the user does not use. 
                Not only does this create an interface tailored to their personal preferences, but can also mitigate 
                possible errors as the interface will be simpler and more convenient to select features they typically use.<br>

                <img src="calendar/color.png" alt="colorwheel" height="250px">
                <img src="calendar/color.gif" alt="colorwheel" height="250px">
                <br>Another redesign is a color wheel option. Google Calendar comes with a set palette of colors for users
                to choose from. A color wheel allows the user to choose exactly what shade of what color they want.<br>

                <img src="calendar/simplify.jpeg" alt="simplify" height="250px">
                <br>Another redesign was just an overall simplification of the interface such as muting the colors and labelling 
                certain functions. This was mainly aimed toward the users who commented that the interface is too cluttered, especially 
                the Google Meet button.<br>

                <img src="calendar/reordering.png" alt="reorder" height="250px">
                <img src="calendar/reordering.gif" alt="reorder" height="250px">
                <br>Another redesign is an option to add or delete main event functions. It is similar to the redesign that allows users to
                reorder and hide features.<br>

                <img src="calendar/theme.gif" alt="theme" height="250px">
                <br>Another redesign are dark mode and theme options to further customize the calendar interface. This makes it easier
                for users to access directly rather than downloading an extension. We added dark mode specifically because everyone likes dark mode 
                now, and it also reduces eye strain. The theme import is just in case users want more than just a light and dark mode.<br>
                
                <img src="calendar/timezone.jpeg" alt="timezone" height="250px">
                <img src="calendar/timezone.gif" alt="timezone" height="250px">
                <br>Another redesign is adding a map to the time zone feature, in order to make it less confusing and more visual for users 
                compared to choosing from a list of options.<br>

                <img src="calendar/timetoleave.gif" alt="timetoleave" height="250px">
                <br>Finally, the time-to-leave redesign is an extra feature that Google Calendar does not have that Apple Calendar does have that users
                commented saying they like.<br>
            </p>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Interview users about the redesign</li>
                    <li>Look at other competing calendars in more depth</li>
                    <li>Build upon the focus on event creation - what about an option to search for
                        events</li>
                    <li>Actually implement this to a real prototype that users can use instead of just
                        Figma prototypes</li>
